                    <p>
                        I have been working as a Software Developer for the past 5 years. I develop software applications that provide Web based solutions to businesses. Most of the projects utilize agile-like development processes using JIRA etc. My day to day includes collaborating with the UX team, resolving front-end bugs and tickets, configuring unit tests/ test libraries and integrating end points. I have a diverse job history which includes sailing on cargo ships, interning as a systems analyst in sales and being a software consultant to large multinational corporations.
